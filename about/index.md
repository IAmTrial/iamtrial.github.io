I am Mir Drualga, author of this web page. You can expect free information about random things I'm interested in.

I write C and C++ software as a hobby. The most widely used project I've written was [SGD2FreeRes](https://github.com/mir-diablo-ii-tools/SlashGaming-Diablo-II-Free-Resolution), a modification to Diablo II to allow custom resolution definitions for the game. I've done other projects due to my enjoyment of the first two Diablo games.

My favorite games are, unsurprisingly, Diablo and Diablo II. For Diablo, I play using DevilutionX. For Diablo II, I play standard/classic mode.
